#Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Python

#Introduction

Mini project 3 was about the study of DSP by analyzing in with the programming language Python. Basic topics of DSP were analyzed such as the frequency domain of a signal using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). A tutorial was followed in order to understand the basics of DSP analysis with python. Libaries that were used included numpy, matplotlib, wave ,and struct. Using these libraries, we can analyze signals.
